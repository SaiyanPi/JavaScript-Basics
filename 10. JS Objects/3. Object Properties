JavaScript Object Properties:

- Properties are key:value Pairs
- Properties can be changed, added, and deleted.

#) Accessing JavaScript Properties:
    - You can access object properties in these ways:
        1. Dot notation
            // objectName.property
            let age = person.age;

        2. Bracket notation
            //objectName["property"]
            let age = person["age"];

        3. Expression
            //objectName[expression]
            let age = person[x];
    
    - Given that the following object:
            const person = {
                first: "Saiyan",
                last: "Pi",
                age: 30,
                bio: function() { 
                    return "Hello developers, I am " + this.first;
                }
            }
        
        1. Dot notation would be:

            let age = person.age;
            let bio = person.bio();
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = `${bio} and i am ${age}.`;
        
        2. Bracket notation would be:

            let age = person["age"];
            let bio = person["bio"]();  👈⚠️
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = `${bio} and i am ${age}.`;
        
        3. Expression would be:

            let x = "age";
            let y = "bio";
            document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = `${person[y]()} and i am ${person[x]}.`;

            -> This is same as the bracket notation except property/method name is stored in
                variable expression

                person["age"] is same as person[x] where variable x = "age"
    
    - 💡 In general, dot notation is preferred for readability and simplicity.
    - ⚠️ Bracket notation is necessary in some cases:
        -> The property name is stored in a variable: person[myVariable]
        -> The property name is not a valid identifier: person["last-name"]


#) Changing Properties:
    - You can change the value of a property:
        
        person.age = 35;

#) Adding New Properties:
    - You can add a new property by simply giving it a value:

        person.address = "Diding";

#) Deleting Properties:
    - The delete keyword deletes a property from an object:

        delete person.age;
        or,
        delete person["age"];
    
    - ⚠️ The delete keyword deletes both the value and the property. After deleting, the property
        is removed. Accessing it will return undefined.

#) Check if a Property Exists:
    - Use the in operator to check if a property exists in an object:

        let result = ("address" in person); // returns true or false

#) Nested Objects:
    - Property values in an object can be other objects:
        myObj = {
            name:"John",
            age:30,
            myCars: {
                car1:"Ford",
                car2:"BMW",
                car3:"Fiat"
            }
        }
    
    - 💡💡 You can access nested objects using the dot notation or the bracket notation:
        Dot notation: 
            myObj.myCars.car1;

        Bracket notation: 
            myObj.myCars["car1"];
            or,
            myObj["myCars"]["car1"];
            or,
            let p1 = "myCars";
            let p2 = "car1";
            myObj[p1][p2];
