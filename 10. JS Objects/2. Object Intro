Object Intro:

#) What are JavaScript Objects?
    - Objects are variables that can store both values and functions.
    - Values are stored as key:value pairs called properties.
    - Functions are stored as key:function() pairs called methods.


#) Real Life Comparison
    - In real life, we can describe subjects as objects (a car, a person, a house)

        Car object: 
            Car

        Car properties: 
            car.name = Fiat
            car.model = 500
            car.weight = 850kg
            car.color = white
        
        Car methods:
            car.start()
            car.drive()
            car.brake()
            car.stop()
    
    - Different cars have the same properties, but the property values can differ from car to car.
    - Different cars have the same methods, but the methods can be performed at different times.


#) Object Example:

        const car = {
            type: "Fiat",
            model: "500",
            color: "white"
        };
    
    - ⚠️ type, model, and color are properties
    - ⚠️ "Fiat", 500, and "white" are property values


#) Object Literal:
    - An object literal "literally" describes an object using a concise syntax with zero or more
        key:value pairs inside curly braces to describe all the object properties:

        {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}


#) How to Create a JavaScript Object:
    - ⚠️ You should declare objects with the const keyword.
    - An object literal is the simplest and most common way to define a JavaScript object.
    - All the examples below, create the same JavaScript object:

        eg 1:
            const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
        
        eg 2:
            const person = {
                firstName: "John",
                lastName: "Doe",
                age: 50,
                eyeColor: "blue"
            };
        
        eg 3: You can also create an empty object, and add the properties later:
            // Create an Object
            const person = {};

            // Add Properties
            person.firstName = "John";
            person.lastName = "Doe";
            person.age = 50;
            person.eyeColor = "blue";
    
        eg 4: Create a new JavaScript object using new Object():
            // Create an Object
            const person = new Object({
                firstName: "John",
                lastName: "Doe",
                age: 50,
                eyeColor: "blue"
            });

        -> ⚠️ There is no need to use new Object(). For readability, simplicity and speed, use an
            object literal instead.


#) Object Properties:
    - You can access object properties in two ways:
        1. Dot notation 
            syntax: objectName.propertyName
            eg: person.firstName;

        2. Bracket notation
            syntax: objectName["propertyName"]
            eg: person["firstName"];


#) JavaScript Object Methods:
    - Objects can also have methods.
    - Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
    - Object methods are function definitions stored as property values

            const person = {
                firstName: "John",
                lastName : "Doe",
                age      : 50,
                fullName : function() {
                    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
                }
            };
        
        Property	    Property Value
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        firstName	    John
        lastName	    Doe
        age	50
        fullName	    function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
    
    ->⚠️ In an object method, this refers to the object.
    ->⚠️ In the example above, this refers to the person object:


#) Summary
    - Objects are containers for Properties and Methods
    - Properties are named Values stored as key:value pairs
    - Methods are Functions stored as key:function() pairs.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

- In JavaScript, Objects are King:

- In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object:
    Objects are objects
    Maths are objects
    Dates are objects
    Arrays are objects
    Maps are objects
    Sets are objects
    RegExp are Objects
    Errors are Objects

- All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
    string	    "Hello"
    number	    3.14
    boolean	    true
    bigint	    12345678901234
    null	    null
    undefined	undefined
    symbol      symbol
