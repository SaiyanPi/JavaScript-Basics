JS Loop for:

-   for (exp 1; exp 2; exp 3) {
        // code block to be executed
    }

    -> exp 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
    -> exp 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
    -> exp 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.


#) How to use exp 1:
    - exp 1 is used to initialize the variable(s) used in the loop (let i = 0).
    - exp 1 is optional.
    - You can omit exp 1 if the value is set before the loop starts:
        eg:
            const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
            let len = cars.length;
            let i = 2;
            let text = "";
            for (; i < len; i++) {
                text += cars[i] + "<br>";
            }


#) How to use exp 2:
    - exp 2 is used to evaluate the condition of the initial variable (i < len).
    - exp 2 is also optional.
    - If exp 2 returns false, the loop will end.
    ⚠️ If you omit exp 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end.
    This will crash your browser.


#) How to use exp 3:
    - exp 3 increments the value of the initial variable (i++).
    - exp 3 is optional.
    - exp 3 can do anything like negative increment (i--), positive increment (i = i + 15), or anything else.
    - exp 3 can be omitted (if you increment the value inside the loop):
        eg:
            const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
            let len = cars.length;

            let i = 0;

            let text = "";
            for (; i < len; ) {
                text += cars[i] + "<br>";
                i++;
            }
