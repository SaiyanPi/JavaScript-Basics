JS Loops:

- oops can execute a block of code a number of times.
- Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different
    value. Often this is the case when working with arrays:
    Instead of writing:

            text += cars[1] + "<br>";
            text += cars[2] + "<br>";
            text += cars[3] + "<br>";
            text += cars[4] + "<br>";
            text += cars[5] + "<br>";
    
    you can write:

            for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
                text += cars[i] + "<br>";
            }


#) The For Loop:
    - The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
            
            for (expr1; expr2; expr) {
                // code block to be executed
            }
        
        -> exp1 is executed one time before the execution of the code block.
        -> exp2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
        -> exp3 is executed every time the code block has been executed.

            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
            }
        -> exp1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).
        -> exp2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).
        -> exp3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block has been executed.


#) Loop Scope: 

    ⚠️ CASE 1:
            let i = 5;
            for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                // some code
            }
            // Here i is 10 because value of i gets reassigned from the loop


    ⚠️ CASE 2:        
            let i = 5;
            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                // some code
            }
            // Here i is 5

        -> let is block scoped so outside loop i = 5


#) The While Loop:
    - The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    - syntax:
            while (condition) {
                // code block to be executed
            }
    - In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as
        a variable (i) is less than 10:

            while (i < 10) {
                text += "The number is " + i;
                i++;
            }
    
    - ⚠️ If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end.
        This will crash your browser.


#) The Do While Loop:
    - The do while loop is a variant of the while loop.
    - The do while loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
        then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
    - syntax:
            do {
                // code block to be executed
            }
            while (condition);
    
    - ⚠️ The do while runs at least once, even if the condition is false from the start.
        This is because the code block is executed before the condition is tested and Do not forget
        to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

            do {
                text += "The number is " + i;
                i++;
            }
            while (i < 10);
