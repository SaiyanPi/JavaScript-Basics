JS while loops:

- While loops execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- JavaScript have two types of while loops:
    1. The while loop
        - 💡 A while loop is much the same as a for loop, with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted.

            while (i < 10) {
                text += "The number is " + i;
                i++;
            }

    2. The do while loop
            do {
                text += "The number is " + i;
                i++;
            }
            while (i < 10);
