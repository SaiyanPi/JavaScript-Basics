JS Break:

- The break statement "jumps out" of loops and switches.
- The break statement terminates the execution of a loop or a switch statement.


#) Break in Loops:
    - When break is encountered in a loop, the loop terminates immediately.
    - The program control is transfered to the statements following the loop.
    - No more loop iterations are executed.

            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                if (i === 3) { break; }
                text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
            }

            o/p: 
                The number is 0
                The number is 1
                The number is 2


#) Break in a Switch:
    - In a switch statement, a break statement will exit the switch block after a matching case is executed. 
        Without break, execution would "fall through" to subsequent case blocks.

            switch (new Date().getDay()) {
                case 0:
                    day = "Sunday";
                    break;
                case 1:
                    day = "Monday";
                    break;
                case 2:
                    day = "Tuesday";
                    break;
                case 3:
                    day = "Wednesday";
                    break;
                case 4:
                    day = "Thursday";
                    break;
                case 5:
                    day = "Friday";
                    break;
                case 6:
                    day = "Saturday";
            }

            o/p: Tuesday (current day)

    - ⚠️ WITHOUT BREAK, THE CODE WILL CONTINUE TO EXECUTE THE NEXT CASE BLOCKS (AND THE DEFAULT BLOCK IF
        PRESENT)EVEN IF THEIR VALUES DO NOT MATCH THE EXPRESSION.

            switch (new Date().getDay()) {
                case 0:
                    day = "Sunday";
                    
                case 1:
                    day = "Monday";
                    
                case 2:
                    day = "Tuesday";
                    
                case 3:
                    day = "Wednesday";
                    
                case 4:
                    day = "Thursday";
                   
                case 5:
                    day = "Friday";
                    
                case 6:
                    day = "Saturday";
            }

            o/p: Saturday (regardless of the current day day will always be Saturday)


#) JavaScript Labels:
    - A label provides a name for a statement, or a block of statements, allowing statements
        to be referenced to, for program flow control, particularly in loops.
    - syntax:
            labelname: statement; 

            or

            labelname: {
                statements
            }


#) Labeled Break:
    - The break statement exits a loop or block and transfers the control to the labeled statement.
    - The break statement is particularly useful for breaking out of inner or outer loops from nested loops.
    - syntax:
            break labelname;

        eg: break to loop 1 💡
            
            loop1: for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
                text2 += `Outer loop iteration: ${i} <br>`;
                loop2: for(let j = 0; j < 5; j++){
                    if(j === 2){
                        break loop1;
                    }
                    text3 += `Inner loop iteration: ${j} <br>` ;
                }
            }

            o/p: 
                Outer loop iteration: 0

                Inner loop iteration: 0
                Inner loop iteration: 1
        

        eg: break loop 2 💡

            loop1: for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
                text2 += `Outer loop iteration: ${i} <br>`;
                loop2: for(let j = 0; j < 5; j++){
                    if(j === 2){
                        break loop2;
                    }
                    text3 += `Inner loop iteration: ${j} <br>` ;
                }
            }

            o/p:
                Outer loop iteration: 0
                Outer loop iteration: 1
                Outer loop iteration: 2
                Outer loop iteration: 3
                Outer loop iteration: 4

                Inner loop iteration: 0
                Inner loop iteration: 1
                Inner loop iteration: 0
                Inner loop iteration: 1
                Inner loop iteration: 0
                Inner loop iteration: 1
                Inner loop iteration: 0
                Inner loop iteration: 1
                Inner loop iteration: 0
                Inner loop iteration: 1
    
    - ⚠️ Without a label reference, break can only jump out of a loop or a switch.
    - With a label reference, break can jump out of any code block:
