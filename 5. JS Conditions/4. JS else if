JS else if:

- Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first is false.
- syntax:
            if (condition1) {
                // code to execute if condition1 is true
            } else if (condition2) {
                // code to execute if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
            } else {
                // code to execute if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
            }

- eg, If time is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting, if not, but time is less than 20:00,
    create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise a "Good evening":
