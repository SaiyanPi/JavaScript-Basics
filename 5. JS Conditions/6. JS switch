JS switch:

- Based on a condition, switch selects one or more code blocks to be executed.
- switch executes the code blocks that matches an expression.
- switch is often used as a more readable alternative to many if...else if...else statements,
    especially when dealing with multiple possible values.
- syntax:
            switch(expression) {
            case x:
                // code block
                break;
            case y:
                // code block
                break;
            default:
                // code block
            }

- eg, uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

            let day;
            let date = new Date().getDay();
            switch (date) {
                case 0:
                    day = "Sunday";
                    break;
                case 1:
                    day = "Monday";
                    break;
                case 2:
                    day = "Tuesday";
                    break;
                case 3:
                    day = "Wednesday";
                    break;
                case 4:
                    day = "Thursday";
                    break;
                case 5:
                    day = "Friday";
                    break;
                case  6:
                    day = "Saturday";
            }
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "Today is " + day;
    
    
    📃 The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.
        (Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)
