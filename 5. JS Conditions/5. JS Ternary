JS Ternary:

- Use (? :) (ternary) as a shorthand for if...else.
- 💡 It is called a ternary operator because it takes three operands.
- syntax:
            condition ? expression1 : expression2

- eg, If the value of age is < 18, set the value of text to "Minor", otherwise to "Adult":

            let text = (age < 18) ? "Minor" : "Adult";
            document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = text;

- The conditional operator is a shorthand for writing conditional if...else statements.
- 🚦 The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands.
