#) What is JavaScript Temporal?
    - Temporal is the new standard for date and time in JavaScript.
    - Temporal is a built-in JavaScript API that provides date and time objects that are easier and
        safer to use than Date.
    - New Temporal objects was designed to replace the old Date object.
    - Unlike legacy Date, Temporal objects are immutable(meaning they cannot be changed after they
        are created) and provide first-class support for time
        zones, daylight saving time (DST), date math and non-Gregorian calendars.
    - Temporal separates date and time into distinct classes to prevent "wall-clock" errors.

        Feature	                    Date	        Temporal
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
        Mutable (can change)	    Yes	            No
        Time zone handling	        Limited	        Built-in
        DST safe math	            No	            Yes
        Modern API design	        No	            Yes


#) Why Was Temporal Created?
    - The Date object was created in 1995 and has some design issues that still cause bugs today.
    - For example, ⚠️ months in Date are zero-based, which is confusing.
            let d = new Date(2026, 0, 17); // Month 0 = January
    
    - ⚠️Another problem is that many Date methods change the same object (mutation), which can create
        unexpected results.
            let d = new Date(); // current date: Tue Feb 24 2026 20:10:55 GMT+0545 (Nepal Time)
            d.setDate(d.getDate() + 7); // getDate returns the day of a date as a number (1-31) i.e, 24
                                            setDate sets the day of the date object so new day will be
                                            24+7 = 31
    
    - 💡Temporal was created to solve these issues with clearer object types and predictable behavior.


#) A Simple Temporal Example:
    - With Temporal, you can get today's date and add days in a clear and safe way.
            let today = Temporal.Now.plainDateISO();
            let nextWeek = today.add({ days: 7 });


#) DST-Safe Arithmetic:
    - DST-safe arithmetic ensures time calculations (addition and subtraction) remain accurate across
        Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions, preventing 1-hour errors.
    - It involves using timezone and calendar-aware objects (ZonedDateTime) that understand local
        clock shifts.


#) RFC 5545 iCalendar:
    - RFC 5545, titled iCalendar (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification), is
        the industry standard for exchanging calendar and scheduling information.
    - It allows different systems (like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook) to
        communicate seamlessly.


#) When Should You Use Temporal?
    - Use Temporal when you need reliable date and time handling.
        👉 You need correct time zone support.
        👉 You want safe date arithmetic (add or subtract days, months, years).
        👉 You want to avoid DST bugs.
        👉 You want predictable and readable code.

    - You may still use Date for very simple tasks, or when you must support environments where Temporal is
        not available.


#) Temporal Object Types
    - Temporal includes several object types for different kinds of date and time values:
        💡 Temporal.Instant - An exact moment in time (UTC timestamp).
        💡 Temporal.PlainDate - A date only (year, month, day).
        💡 Temporal.PlainDateTime - Date and time without a time zone.
        💡Temporal.ZonedDateTime - Date and time with a time zone.
        💡 Temporal.Duration - A length of time (days, hours, minutes).

    - Later, you will learn how each type works and when to use it.
