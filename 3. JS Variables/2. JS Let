JS Let:

- The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
- Variables declared with let have Block Scope
- Variables declared with let must be Declared before use
- Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

1) Let is Block Scope:
    - Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.
    - JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.
    - ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
    - These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript.
    - Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
            
        {
            let x = 2;
        }
        // x can NOT be used here

2) var is Global Scope:
    - Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
    - Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:
    - Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

        {
            var x = 2;
        }
        // x CAN be used here

3) let Cannot be Redeclared but var can be redeclare:
    - You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.
    - with let you cannot do this:

        let x = "John Doe";

        let x = 0;  ❌
    
    - Variables defined with var can be redeclared.

        var x = "John Doe";

        var x = 0;  ✅

4) Both let and var can be reassign:
        let a = 1;
        a = 2;   // ✅ allowed

        var b = 1;
        b = 2;   // ✅ allowed

5) Redeclaring Variables in var:
    - Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
    - Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:

        var x = 10;
        // Here x is 10

        {
            var x = 2;
            // Here x is 2
        }

        // Here x is 2
    
    - Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.
    - Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:

        let x = 10;
        // Here x is 10

        {
            let x = 2;
            // Here x is 2
        }

        // Here x is 10
