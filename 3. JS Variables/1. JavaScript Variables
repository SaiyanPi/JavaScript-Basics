JavaScript Variables:

- variables = data containers
- JavaScript variables are containers for data.
- JavaScript variables can be declared in 4 ways:

    Modern JavaScript:
        Using let
        Using const

    Older JavaScript:
        Using var (Not Recommended)
        Automatically (Not Recommended)

1) JavaScript Identifiers:
    - Variables are identified with unique names called identifiers.
        Names can be short like x, y, z. Names can be descriptive age, sum, carName.
    - The rules for constructing names (identifiers) are:
        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        Names must begin with a letter, a $ sign or an underscore (_).
        Names are case sensitive (X is different from x).
        Reserved words (JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
    - Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names. This way JavaScript can easily
        distinguish identifiers from numbers.

2) JavaScript Underscore (_)
    - JavaScript treats underscore as a letter.
    - Identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

            let _lastName = "Johnson";
            let _x = 2;
            let _100 = 5;
    - ✅ A convention among professional programmers is to start a name with underscore for
        "private" variables.

3) JavaScript Dollar Sign $
    - JavaScript also treats a dollar sign as a letter.
    - Identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:

            let $ = "Hello World";
            let $$$ = 2;
            let $myMoney = 5;
    - Using the $ is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as
        an alias for the main function in JavaScript libraries.
    
    (Alias)
    When two variables point to the same object or function, one is an alias of the other.

            const original = { name: "Alex" };
            const alias = original;

            alias.name = "Sam";

            console.log(original.name); // "Sam"

4) Declaring JavaScript Variables
    - Creating a variable in JavaScript is called declaring a variable.
    - You declare a JavaScript variable with the let keyword or the const keyword.

    (i) Declaring a Variable Using let:

            let carName;
        
        -> After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
        -> To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
            carName = "Volvo";
        -> Most often you will assign a value to the variable when you declare it:
            let carName = "Volvo";
        
    (ii) Declaring a Variable Using const:

            const carName = "Volvo";
        
        -> Always use const if the value should not be changed

            const price1 = 5;
            const price2 = 6;
            let total = price1 + price2;

        -> The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
        -> The values of price1 and price2 cannot be changed.
        -> The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
        -> he value of total can be changed.

5) JavaScript Data Types
    - JavaScript variables can hold 8 datatypes, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
    - Strings are text written inside quotes.
    - Numbers are written without quotes. ⚠️ If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as
        a text string.

            const pi = 3.14;
            let person = "John Doe";
            let value = "3.14"  // string type not a number type

6) One Statement, Many Variables
    - You can declare many variables in one statement.
    - Start the statement with let or constand separate the variables by comma:

            let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
    
    - A declaration can span multiple lines:

            let person = "John Doe",
            carName = "Volvo",
            price = 200;

7) The Assignment Operator
    - In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an assignment operator, not an equal to operator.
    - This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

            x = x + 5

        In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
        (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented
        by 5.)
    - The equal to operator is written like == in JavaScript.

8) JavaScript Arithmetic
    - As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:   

            let x = 5 + 2 + 3;

    - You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated:

            let x = "John" + " " + "Doe";
    
    - ⚠️ If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and
        concatenated.

            <p id="demo"> The result of adding "5" + 2 + 3 is: </p>
            <script>
                let x = "5" + 2 + 3;
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
            </script>

            o/p: The result of adding "5" + 2 + 3 is: 523
