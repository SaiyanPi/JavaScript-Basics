JS Constant

- The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
- Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared
- Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

        const PI = 3.141592653589793;
        PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
        PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error

- Variables defined with const have Block Scope
- ⚠️ JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

        const PI;   ❌
        PI = 3.14159265359; 

        const PI = 3.14159265359; ✅

WHEN TO USE JAVASCRIPT CONST?
- Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.
- Use const when you declare:
    A new Array
    A new Object
    A new Function
    A new RegExp

#) Constant Objects and Arrays:
    - 🚨 The keyword const is a little misleading. IT DOES NOT DEFINE A CONSTANT VALUE. IT DEFINES A
        CONSTANT REFERENCE TO A VALUE.
    - Because of this you can NOT:
        -> Reassign a constant value
        -> Reassign a constant array
        -> Reassign a constant object
        But you CAN:
        -> Change the elements of constant array
        -> Change the properties of constant object

    (1) Constant Arrays: 
        - You can change the elements of a constant array and add new element ✅:
           
            eg,
                const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

                // You can change an element:
                cars[0] = "Toyota";

                // You can add an element:
                cars.push("Audi");
        
        - But you can NOT reassign the array ❌:
            
            eg, const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

                cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR
    
    (2) Constant Objects: 
        - You can change the properties of a constant object and add new property ✅:
            
            eg, 
                const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

                // You can change a property:
                car.color = "red";

                // You can add a property:
                car.owner = "Johnson";
        
        - But you can NOT reassign the object ❌:

            eg, const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

                car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"}    // ERROR


#) const is Block Scope:
    - Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.
    - The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared
        outside the block:

            const x = 10;
            // Here x is 10

            {
            const x = 2;
            // Here x is 2
            }

            // Here x is 10

🚦 difference between var, let and const:

            Scope	Redeclare	Reassign	Hoisted	    Binds this
----------------------------------------------------------------------
var	        No	    Yes	        Yes	        Yes	        Yes
let	        Yes	    No	        Yes	        No	        No
const	    Yes	    No	        No	        No	        No

ABSTRACT:

✅ What is Good?
👉 let and const can not be redeclared in the same scope.
👉 let can be reassigned but const can not be reassigned in the same scope.
👉 let and const have block scope.
👉 let and const must be declared before use.
👉 let and const does not bind to this.
👉 let and const are not hoisted.

❌ What is Not Good?
👉 var does not have to be declared.
👉 var is hoisted.
👉 var binds to this.
