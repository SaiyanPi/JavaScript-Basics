JavaScript Array Const:

#) ECMAScript 2015 (ES6):
    - In 2015, JavaScript introduced an important new keyword: const.
    - It has become a common practice to declare arrays using const:


#) Cannot be Reassigned
    - An array declared with const cannot be reassigned:(see chapter 3 section 3)
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ❌ ERROR


⚠️) Arrays are Not Constants
    - The keyword const is a little misleading.
    - It does NOT define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array.
    - Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.


#) Elements Can be Reassigned:
    - You can change the elements of a constant array:
            // You can create a constant array:
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

            // You can change an element:
            cars[0] = "Toyota";

            // You can add an element:
            cars.push("Audi");


#) Assigned when Declared:
    - JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
    - Meaning: An array declared with const must be initialized when it is declared.
    - Using const without initializing the array is a syntax error:
            // ❌ This will not work
            const cars;
            cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    
    -Arrays declared with var can be initialized at any time. You can even use the array before
        it is declared:
            cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            var cars;


#) Const Block Scope
    - An array declared with const has Block Scope.
    - 💡An array declared in a block is not the same as an array declared outside the block:
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            // Here cars[0] is "Saab"
            {
                const cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
                // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
            }
            // Here cars[0] is "Saab"
    
    - 💡An array declared with var does not have block scope:
            var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            // Here cars[0] is "Saab"
            {
                var cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
                // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
            }
            // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"


#) Redeclaring Arrays:
    - 💡Redeclaring an array declared with var is allowed anywhere in a program:
            var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
            var cars = ["Toyota", "BMW"];  // Allowed
            cars = ["Volvo", "Saab"];      // Allowed
    
    - ⚠️Redeclaring or reassigning an array to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is
        not allowed:
            var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Allowed
            const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
            {
                var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
                const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
            }
    
    - ⚠️Redeclaring or reassigning an existing const array, in the same scope, or in the same block,
        is not allowed:
            const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
            const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
            var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Not allowed
            cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];         // Not allowed

            {
                const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
                const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
                var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
                cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];       // Not allowed
            }
    
    - ⚠️Redeclaring an array with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:
            const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
            {
                const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
            }
            {
                const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
            }
