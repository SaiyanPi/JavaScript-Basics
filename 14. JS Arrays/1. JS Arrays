JavaScript Arrays:

- An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.
- Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:
    👉 Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.
    👉 Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.
    👉 Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
    👉 Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
    👉 Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings,
        objects and other arrays).


#) Why Use Arrays?
    - An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring
        to an index number.
    - If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the names in single
        variables could look like this:
            let car1 = "Saab";
            let car2 = "Volvo";
            let car3 = "BMW";

        However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you
        had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution is an array!


#) Creating an Array:
    - Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.
            Syntax: const array_name = [item1, item2, ...]; 

    - ✅ It is a common practice to declare arrays with the const keyword.
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

    - Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:
            const cars = [
                "Saab",
                "Volvo",
                "BMW"
            ];

    - You can also create an empty array, and provide elements later:
            const cars = [];
            cars[0]= "Saab";
            cars[1]= "Volvo";
            cars[2]= "BMW";


#) Using the JavaScript Keyword new:
    - new Array() also creates an Array. For example, following example creates an array and assigns
        value to it.
            const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");

    - There is no need to use new Array().
    - For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.


#) Accessing Array Elements:
    - You access an array element by referring to the index number:
    - Array indexes start with 0.
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            let car = cars[0];  // Saab


#) Changing an Array Element:
    - This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            cars[0] = "Opel";


#) Adding Array Elements:
    - The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method:
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
            fruits.push("Lemon");  // Adds a new element (Lemon) to fruits

    - 💡 New element can also be added to an array using the length property:
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
            fruits[fruits.length] = "Lemon";  // Adds "Lemon" to fruits

        -> The length property is always one more than the highest array index. In above example 
            fruits.length = 3

    - ⚠️ Adding elements with high indexes can create undefined "holes" in an array:
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
            fruits[6] = "Lemon";  // Creates undefined "holes" in fruits


#) Converting an Array to a String: 
    - The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array
        values.
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits.toString();  // Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango

    - ⚠️ JavaScript automatically converts an array to a comma separated string when a primitive value
        is expected. This is always the case when you try to output an array.
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fruits; 
            // same result as fruits.toString()

#) Access the Full Array:
    - With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name:
            document.getElementById("2").innerHTML = fruits;    // Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango


#) Arrays are Objects:
    - Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for
        arrays.
    - But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.
    - 🚦 Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". Objects use names to access its "members". 


#) Array Elements Can Be Objects:
    - JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.
    - Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.
    👉 You can have objects in an Array.
    👉 You can have functions in an Array.
    👉 You can have arrays in an Array:
            
            myArray[0] = Date.now;
            myArray[1] = myFunction;
            myArray[2] = myCars;


#) The Difference Between Arrays and Objects:
    👉 In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes. Objects use named indexes.
    - Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

#) Associative Arrays:
    - Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.
    - Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).
    - JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.
    - In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes. 
    ⚠️ If you use named indexes, JavaScript will redefine the array to an object. After that, some
        array methods and properties will produce incorrect results.
        
        Associative Array:(named index)
            const person = [];                  // array
            person["firstName"] = "John";       // adding/changing element with index named 'firstName'
            person["lastName"] = "Doe";
            person["age"] = 46;
            person.length;                      // Will return 0 ❌
            person[0];                          // Will return undefined ❌
        
        Array:(numbered index)
            const person = [];
            person[0] = "John";                 // adding/changing element with index 0      
            person[1] = "Doe";
            person[2] = 46;
            person.length;                      // Will return 3 ✅
            person[0];                          // Will return "John" ✅


#) When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects:
    - JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
    - You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
    - You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.


#) JavaScript new Array():
    - JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().
    - But you can safely use [] instead.
    - These two different statements both create a new empty array named points:
            const points = new Array();
            const points = [];
    
    - These two different statements both create a new array containing 6 numbers:
            const points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10);
            const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
    
    ⚠️ The new keyword can produce some unexpected results:
        1) const points = new Array(40, 100, 1);
        -> creates an array with three elements(40,100,1) as expected

        2) const points = new Array(40, 100);
        -> creates an array with two elements(40,100) as expected

        3) const points = new Array(40); 
        -> Create an array with one(40) element ??? No ❌
        -> instead we get array (,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,)

    ⚠️ const points = [40]; is not the same as: const points = new Array(40);
        const points = [40]; creates an array with one element
        const points = new Array(40); creates an array with 40 undefined elements.


#) How to Recognize an Array:
    - A common question is: How do I know if a variable is an array?
    - The problem is that the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object":
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
            let type = typeof fruits;   // object
    
    Solution 1:
        -> To solve this problem ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 2009) defined a new method Array.isArray():
            Array.isArray(fruits);  // true
    
    Solution 2:
        -> The instanceof operator returns true if an object is created by a given constructor:
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
            (fruits instanceof Array);  // true


#) Looping Array Elements:
    - One way to loop through an array, is using a for loop:
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
            let fLen = fruits.length;
            let text = "";
            for(let i = 0; i < fLen; i ++) {
                text += `<li> ${fruits[i]} </li>`;
            }
            document.getElementById("1").innerHTML = text;

            o/p:    Banana
                    Orange
                    Apple
                    Mango
    
    - You can also use the Array.forEach() function:
            let text1 = "";
            fruits.forEach(myFunction);
            function myFunction(value) {
                text1 += `<li> ${value} </li>`
            }
            document.getElementById("2").innerHTML = text1;

            o/p:    Banana
                    Orange
                    Apple
                    Mango


#) Nested Arrays and Objects:
    - Values in objects can be arrays, and values in arrays can be objects:
            const myObj = {
                name: "John",
                age: 30,
                cars: [
                    {name:"Ford", models:["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"]},
                    {name:"BMW", models:["320", "X3", "X5"]},
                    {name:"Fiat", models:["500", "Panda"]}
                ]
            }
    
    - To access arrays inside arrays, use a for-in loop for each array:

            let text3 = "";
            for(let i in myObj.cars) {
                text3 += `<br><b> ${myObj.cars[i].name} </b><br>`;
                for(let j in myObj.cars[i].models) {
                    text3 += `${myObj.cars[i].models[j]} <br>`
                }
            }
            document.getElementById("3").innerHTML = text3;

            o/p:    Ford
                    Fiesta
                    Focus
                    Mustang

                    BMW
                    320
                    X3
                    X5

                    Fiat
                    500
                    Panda
