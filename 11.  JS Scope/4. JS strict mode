JavaScript Use Strict

- The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.
- It defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".
- It is not a statement. It is a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
- The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
- With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.


#) Declaring Strict Mode:
    - Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
    - Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute
        in strict mode):

            "use strict";
            x = 3.14;       // This will cause an error because x is not declared

            "use strict";
            myFunction();   // invoking function
            function myFunction() {
                y = 3.14;   // This will also cause an error because y is not declared
            }

            x = 3.14;       // This will not cause an error.
            myFunction();
            function myFunction() {
                "use strict";
                y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error
            }


#) Why Strict Mode?
    - Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
    - Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
    - As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable.
        In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global
        variable.
    - In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to
        non-writable properties.
    - In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a
        non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.


#) Not Allowed in Strict Mode:
    1. Using a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
        "use strict";
        x = 3.14;                // This will cause an error
    
    2. Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed: (Objects are variables too.)
        "use strict";
        x = {p1:10, p2:20};      // This will cause an error
    
    3. Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.
        "use strict";
        function x(p1, p2) {};
        delete x;                // This will cause an error 
    
    4. Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:
        "use strict";
        function x(p1, p1) {};   // This will cause an error

    5. Octal numeric literals are not allowed:
        "use strict";
        let x = 010;             // This will cause an error
    
    6. Octal escape characters are not allowed:
        "use strict";
        let x = "\010";            // This will cause an error
    
    7. Writing to a read-only property is not allowed:
        "use strict";
        const obj = {};
        Object.defineProperty(obj, "x", {value:0, writable:false});
        obj.x = 3.14;            // This will cause an error
    
    8. Writing to a get-only property is not allowed:
        "use strict";
        const obj = {get x() {return 0} };
        obj.x = 3.14;            // This will cause an error
    
    9. Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:
        "use strict";
        delete Object.prototype; // This will cause an error
    
    10. The word eval cannot be used as a variable:
        "use strict";
        let eval = 3.14;         // This will cause an error

    11. The word arguments cannot be used as a variable:
        "use strict";
        let arguments = 3.14;    // This will cause an error
    
    12. The with statement is not allowed:
        "use strict";
        with (Math){x = cos(2)}; // This will cause an error
    
    13. For security reasons, eval() is not allowed to create variables in the scope from
        which it was called.
        - In strict mode, a variable can not be used before it is declared:
            
            "use strict";
            eval ("x = 2");
            alert (x);      // This will cause an error
        
        - In strict mode, eval() can not declare a variable using the var keyword:

            "use strict";
            eval ("var x = 2");
            alert (x);    // This will cause an error
        
        - eval() can not declare a variable using the let keyword:

            eval ("let x = 2");
            alert (x);        // This will cause an error
    
    14. As we already know, The this keyword refers to the object that called the function.
        If the object is not specified, functions in strict mode will return undefined instead of
        global object (window):

            "use strict";
            function myFunction() {
                alert(this);    // will alert "undefined"
            }
            myFunction();
    
    15. Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict
        mode.

            implements
            interface
            let
            package
            private
            protected
            public
            static
            yield

                "use strict";
                let public = 1500;      // This will cause an error


⚠️ The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.
