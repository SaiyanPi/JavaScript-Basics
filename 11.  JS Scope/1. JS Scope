JavaScript Scope:

- Scope = Visibility
- Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.
- JavaScript variables have 3 types of scope:
    1. Global scope
    2. Function scope
    3. Block scope


1) Global Scope:
    - Variables declared Globally (outside any block or function) have Global Scope.
    - Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
    - ⚠️ Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
        They all have Global Scope:

            let carName = "Volvo";
            // code here can use carName

            function myFunction() {
                // code here can also use carName
            }


2) Function Scope:
    - Each JavaScript function have their own scope.
    - Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
    - ⚠️ Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

            function myFunction1() {
                var carName = "Volvo";  // Function Scope
            }
            // carName cannot be used here

            function myFunction2() {
                let carName = "Volvo";  // Function Scope
            }
            // carName cannot be used here

            function myFunction3() {
                const carName = "Volvo";  // Function Scope
            }
            // carName cannot be used here
    
    - ⚠️ Local Variables has Function Scope
        -> They can only be accessed from within the function
        -> No scripts or functions outside the function can access them
        -> Variables with the same name can be used outside the function
        -> Variables with the same name can be used in different functions
        -> Local variables are created when a function starts
        -> Local variables are deleted when the function is completed
        -> Arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions


3) Block Scope:
    - Before ES6, JavaScript variables could only have Global Scope or Function Scope.
    - ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
    - These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
    - Variables declared with let and const inside a code block are "block-scoped," meaning they are
        only accessible within that block. This helps prevent unintended variable overwrites and
        promotes better code organization:

            {
                let x = 2;
            }
            // x can NOT be used here
    
    - ⚠️ Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope. Variables declared with
        the var keyword, inside a { } block; can be accessed from outside the block.

            {
                var x = 2;
            }
            // x CAN be used here


⚠️) Automatically Global:
    - If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will become a GLOBAL
        variable.
    - This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned
        inside a function.

            myFunction();

            // code here can use carName

            function myFunction() {
                carName = "Volvo";
            }


#) Strict Mode:
    - All modern browsers support running JavaScript in "Strict Mode".
    - ⚠️ In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.


#) Global Variables in HTML:
    - With JavaScript, the global scope is the JavaScript environment.
    - In HTML, the global scope is the window object.
    - ⚠️ Global variables defined with the var keyword belong to the window object:
        
        (Not recommended)
        <script>
            var carName = "Volvo";

            // code here can use window.carName
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I can display " + window.carName;
        </script>
    
    - ⚠️ Global variables defined with the let keyword do not belong to the window object:

        <script>
            let carName = "Volvo";

            // code here can not use window.carName (window.carName = undefined)
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "I can not display " + window.carName;
        </script>


💀💀💀💀
Warning: Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to.
    Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions).
    Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions.


#) The Lifetime of JavaScript Variables
    - The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared.
    - Function (local) variables are deleted when the function is completed.
    - In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).
