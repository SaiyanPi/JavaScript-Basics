JavaScript Hoisting:

- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current
    scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).


#) JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted: (declarations are move to top)
    - In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
    - In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
        Example 1 gives the same result as Example 2:

        Example 1:

            x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
            elem = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;  // 5
            var x; // Declare x
        
        Example 2:

            var x; // Declare x
            x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
            elem = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;   // 5                


#) The var Keyword:
    - ⚠️ VARIABLES DEFINED WITH VAR ARE HOISTED TO THE TOP OF THE BLOCK, AND INITIALIAZED WITH 
        UNDEFINED.

            console.log(a);  // undefined
            var a = 5;
            console.log(a);  // 5

        Behind the scene:

            var a = undefined;  // Hoisting phase: initialized with undefined
            console.log(a);     // Execution phase: undefined
            a = 5;              // basically reassigning the new value
            console.log(a);     // 5


#) The let and const Keywords:
    - ⚠️ VARIABLES DEFINED WITH LET AND CONST ARE HOISTED TO THE TOP OF THE BLOCK, BUT NOT
        INITIALIZED.
    - Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been
        declared.
    - let:
        -> Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
        -> The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared:

            try {
                b = "Toyota"    // using before declaration
                let b;          // declaration
            }
            catch(err3) {
                document.getElementById("3").innerHTML = err3;  // ReferenceError
            }
    
    - const:
        -> Using a const variable before it is declared, is a syntax error, so the code will simply
            not run.

            // code will not run
            try {
                c = "Toyota"     
                const b;        // syntax error 
            }
            catch(err4) {
                document.getElementById("4").innerHTML = err4;
            }


#) JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted:
    - ⚠️ JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
    - Example 1 does not give the same result as Example 2:
        Example 1:
                var x = 5; // Initialize x
                var y = 7; // Initialize y
                elem = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + " " + y; // 5 7
        
        Example 2:
                var x = 5; // Initialize x
                elem = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + " " + y; // 5 undefined
                var y = 7; // Initialize y
            
        -> This is because only the declaration (var y), not the initialization (=7) is hoisted to
            the top.
        -> when we initialize y, we are also declaring y so the declaration part gets hoisted and
            variable declared with var are hoisted and initialized with undefined. That is why we get
            undefined.
            What happens internally:

                var x = undefined;
                var y = undefined;
                x = 5;
                elem = document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + " " + y;
                y = 7;


#) Declare Your Variables At the Top !:
    - Hoisting is (to many developers) an unknown or overlooked behavior of JavaScript.
    - If a developer doesn't understand hoisting, programs may contain bugs (errors).
    - To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
    - Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.
