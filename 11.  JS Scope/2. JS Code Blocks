JS Code Blocks:

#) Curly Braces:
    - A code block or block statement is a group of statements enclosed within curly braces { }.
    - Code blocks are important for controlling the flow of execution and defining variable scope
        within a JavaScript program.


#) Code Blocks and Statements:
    - Code blocks allows for multiple statements to be treated as a single unit.
    - The body of a JavaScript function is always enclosed within a code block:

        function myFunction() {
            // This is a code block
        }
    
    - Code blocks are essential for if statements:
        if (condition) {
            // This is a code block
        } else {
            // This is a code block
        }
    
    - Code blocks are essential for loop statements:
        for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
            // This is a code block
        }

        while (condition) {
            // This is a code block
        }


#) Defining Scope:
    - Variables declared with let and const inside a code block are "block-scoped," meaning they
        are only accessible within that specific block.
    - This helps prevent unintended variable overwrites and promotes better code organization:

        {
        let x = 10;
            // x is accessible here
        }

        // x is not accessible here


⚠️) Standalone Blocks:
    - Code blocks can also exist independently without being attached to an if statement, a function
        or a loop.
    - This can be used to create a scope for let and const variables.

        {
            let x = 10;
            let y = 100;
            let areal = x * y;
        }
        this code demonstrates how a standalone block can be used to limit the scope of variables.
