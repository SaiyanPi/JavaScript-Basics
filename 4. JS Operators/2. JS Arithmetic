JS Arithmetic:

#) Arithmetic Operations:
    - A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.
        1. The two numbers can be literals:

            let x = 100 + 50;
        
        2. or variables:

            let x = a + b;
        
        3. or expressions:

            let x = (100 + 50) * a;


#) Incrementing/Decrementing:
    - The increment operator (++) increments numbers.
    - The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.

            let x = 5;
            x++;
            let z = x;  // 6

            let a = 5;
            a--;
            let b = a;  // 4


#) Exponentiation:
    - The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
        eg,
            let x = 5;
            let z = x ** 2; // z = 25
    
    - x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y):
        eg,
            let x = 5;
            let z = Math.pow(x,2);  // z = 25


#) Operator Precedence:
    - Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic
        expression.
        -> Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and 
            ubtraction (-).
        -> When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first:

            let x = (100 + 50) * 3; // 450
            let x = 100 + 50 * 3;   // 250
        
        -> When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or
            multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right:

            let x = 100 + 50 - 3;   // 150-3 = 147
            let x = 100 / 50 * 3;   // 2 * 3 = 6
