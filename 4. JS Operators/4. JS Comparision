JS Comparision:

#) Comparison Operators:
    - Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
    - Comparison operators always return true or false.
        Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:

        Operator	    Description	                        Comparing	        Returns	
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ==	            equal to	                        x == 8	            false	
                                                            x == 5	            true	
                                                            x == "5"	        true

        ===	            equal value and equal type	        x === 5	            true	
                                                            x === "5"	        false	

        !=	            not equal	                        x != 8	            true	

        !==	            not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	            false	
                                                            x !== "5"	        true	
                                                            x !== 8	            true	

        >	            greater than	                    x > 8	            false

        <	            less than	                        x < 8	            true	

        >=	            greater than or equal to	        x >= 8	            false	

        <=	            less than or equal to	            x <= 8	            true
    
    - Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action
        depending on the result:

            if (age < 18) text = "Too young to buy alcohol";


#) JavaScript String Comparison:
    - All the comparison operators above can also be used on strings:
    - ⚠️ Note that strings are compared alphabetically:

            let text1 = "A";
            let text2 = "B";
            let result = text1 < text2; // true

            let text1 = "20";
            let text2 = "5";
            let result = text1 < text2; // true
        
        🚦 Explanation:
        JavaScript compares from left to right, one character at a time.
        Step 1: compare first characters
                '2' vs '5'
                Unicode values: '2' => 50, '5' => 53
                since 50 < 53, result is true


#) Comparing Different Types:
    - Comparing data of different types may give unexpected results.
    - ⚠️ When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when
        doing the comparison.
      ⚠️ An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN (Not-a-Number) which is
        always false.

        Case	            Value	    Explanation
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        2 < 12	            true	

        2 < "12"	        true        converting string '12' to a number is 12 and 2 < 12   

        2 < "John"	        false	    2 < NaN

        2 > "John"	        false	    2 > NaN

        2 == "John"	        false	    2 == NaN

        "2" < "12"	        false	    Unicode value of 2 is 50, Unicode value of 1 is 49 so 50 < 49

        "2" > "12"	        true	    50 > 49

        "2" == "12"	        false       50 == 49

    ⚠️ When both comparing operands are string, js compares character by character from left to right.
        Each character is converted to Unicode and compares the unicode value
            
            eg:  "2" < "12" is equivalent to 50 < 49

    ⚠️ When two comparing operands are of different type say number and string, first string is converted
        into a number and then the comparision is done.
            
            eg: 2 < "12" is equivalent to 2 < 12
    
    - To secure a proper result, variables should be converted to the proper type before comparison:

            <p id = "body"></p>
            <input id = "age" value = "18" />
            <button onClick = "myFunction()"> Try it </button>

            <script>
                function myFunction(){
                    let voteable;
                    let age = Number(document.getElementById("age").value);

                    if(isNaN(age)){
                        voteable = "Input is not a number"
                    } else {
                        voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
                    }
                    document.getElementById("body").innerHTML = voteable + "to vote";
                }
            </script>
