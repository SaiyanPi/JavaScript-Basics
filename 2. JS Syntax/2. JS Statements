JS Statements:

1) JavaScript Programs:
    - A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
    - These programming instructions are called statements.
    - Most JavaScript programs contain many statements
    - The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
    - In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

2) JavaScript Statements:
    - JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
    - The following  statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element
        with id="demo":

            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
    
    - JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

3) Semicolons ;
    - Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
    - Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

            let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
            a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
            b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
            c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c
    
    - When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

            a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

4) JavaScript White Space:
    - JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more
        readable. The following lines are equivalent:

            let person = "Hege";
            let person="Hege";
    
    - A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

            let x = y + z;

5) JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
    - For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
    - If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an 
        operator:

            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
            "Hello Dolly!";

6) JavaScript Code Blocks:
    - JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
    - The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.
    - One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:

            function myFunction() {
                document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
                document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
            }

7) JavaScript Keywords:
    - JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be
        performed.
    - Here is a list of some of the keywords 

        Keyword	                        Description
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        var	                            Declares a variable
        let	                            Declares a block variable
        const	                        Declares a block constant
        if	                            Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
        switch	                        Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
        for	                            Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
        function	                    Declares a function
        return	                        Exits a function
        try	                            Implements error handling to a block of statements
