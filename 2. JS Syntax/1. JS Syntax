JS Syntax:

1) Syntax rules:
    // How to Declare variables:
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;

    // How to Compute values:
    let z = x + y;

    // I am a Comment. I do Nothing

2) JavaScript Values:
    - The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
        (i) Literals (Fixed values)
        (ii) Variables (Variable values)
    
3) JavaScript Literals:
    - The most important syntax rules for literals (fixed values) are:

        (i) Numbers are written with or without decimals:
            eg, 10.50 or 1001

        (ii) Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
            eg, "John Doe" or 'John Doe'

4) JavaScript Keywords:
    - JavaScript keywords are used to defines actions to be performed.
    - The let and const keywords create variables:

            let x = 5;
            const fname = "John";

    - JavaScript keywords are case-sensitive.
        JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.

5) JavaScript Variables:
    - Variables are containers for storing data values.
    - Variables must be identified with unique names.

            // Define x as a variable
            let x;

            // Assign the value 6 to x
            x = 6;
