JS Comments:

- JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
- JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

1) Single Line Comments
    - Single line comments start with //.

            // Change heading:
            document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

            // Change paragraph:
            document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

2) Multi-line Comments
    - Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

            /*
            The code below will change
            the heading with id = "myH"
            and the paragraph with id = "myP"
            in my web page:
            */
            document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
            document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
