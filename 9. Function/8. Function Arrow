8. Arrow Function

- Arrow Functions allow a shorter syntax for function expressions.
- Arrow Functions were introduced in ES6 and are commonly used in modern JavaScript.

#) Shorter Syntax:
    - 💡 If the function body contains only one statement, You can remove the word function,
        the curly brackets and the return keyword.

        Before Arrow:

            const add = function(a, b) {return a * b;};
        
        With Arrow:

            const add = (a, b) => a * b;
    
    - 💡 If the function signature contains only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses.

        Before Arrow:

            const discount = function(price) { return (price/100) * 15; };
        
        With Arrow:

            const discount = price => (price/100) * 15;
    
    - 💡 If there are no parameters, parentheses are required.

        Before Arrow:

            const hello = function() { return "Hello"; };
        
        After Arrow:

            const hello = () => "Hello";
    
    - ⚠️ You can only omit the return keyword and the curly brackets if the function is a single
        statement. Because of this, it might be a good habit to always keep them:

            const add = (a, b) => { return a * b };
            const discount = price => { return (price/100) * 15 };
            const hello = () => { return "Hello" };



⚠️) Arrow Functions Are Not Declarations:
    - Arrow functions are always expressions (not simply a function/declaration) and must be
        assigned to a variable.
    - So just like the function expression, arrow function cannot be used before they are defined.
        No hoisting.

            hello();    ❌ error

            const hello = () => "Hello";
    
    - Arrow function must be defined before they are used.



⚠️⚠️) Arrow Functions and the this Keyword:
    - Arrow functions do not have their own this value.
    - They inherit this from the surrounding code.

        // regular function inside an object as an object method
            const person = {    
                name: "John",
                greet: function() { 
                    return "Hello " + this.name;    //✅ John
                }
            }
            document.getElementById("regular").innerHTML = person.greet();  // ✅ Hello John

            -> here this refers to the object
            -> if we console.log(this) inside function before retuyrn statement, we will get
                the object 



        // arrow function inside an object as an object method
            const dog = {   // dog object
                name: "Coco",
                call: () => {   // arrow function as object property
                    return "Hello " + this.name;    // ❌ nothing
                }
            }
            document.getElementById("arrow").innerHTML = dog.call();    // ❌ Hello
        
            -> here, this refers to the window.
            -> if we console.log(this) inside function before retuyrn statement, we will get
                the owindow.


#) When to use and when not to use arrow function:
    - Use:
        -> For short functions
        -> For callbacks and array methods
        -> When you do not need your own this
    
    - Not use:
        -> As object methods
        -> When you need your own this
        -> When using function declarations
