JS Numbers:

- JavaScript has only one type of number.
- Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
    eg:
        let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
        let y = 3;       // A number without decimals

- Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation:
    eg:
        let x = 123e5;    // 12300000
        let y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123


#) JavaScript Numbers are Always double(64-bit Floating Point):
    - Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript does not define different types of numbers,
        like integers, short, long, floating-point etc.
    - JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the
        international IEEE 754 standard.
    - This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51,
        the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63:

        Value (aka Fraction/Mantissa)	        Exponent	            Sign
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        52 bits (0 - 51) 	                    11 bits (52 - 62)	    1 bit (63)


#) Integer Precision:
    - Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.

            let x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999
            let y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000
    
    - The maximum number of decimals is 17.


#) Floating Precision:
    - Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate:

            let x = 0.2 + 0.1;  // 0.30000000000000004
    
    - To solve the problem above, it helps to multiply and divide:

            let x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10; // 0.3


#) Adding Numbers and Strings:
    ⚠️ JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
        Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.

            let x = 10;
            let y = 20;
            let z = x + y;  // 30

            let x = "10";
            let y = "20";
            let z = x + y;  // 1020
    
    - If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation:

            let x = 10;
            let y = "20";
            let z = x + y;  // 1020
    
    ⚠️ A common mistake is to expect this result to be 30:

            let x = 10;
            let y = 20;
            let z = "The result is: " + x + y;  // The result is: 1020
    
    ⚠️ A common mistake is to expect this result to be 102030:

            let x = 10;
            let y = 20;
            let z = "30";
            let result = x + y + z; // 3030
        
        -> The JavaScript interpreter works from left to right.
        -> First 10 + 20 is added because x and y are both numbers.
        -> Then 30 + "30" is concatenated because z is a string.


#) Numeric strings:
    - JavaScript strings can have numeric content:
    - JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations except addition(+).
        eg:

            let x = "100";
            let y = "10";
            let z = x + y;  // 10010 ❌ does not work

            let x = "100";
            let y = "10";
            let z = x - y;  // 90 ✅ works

            let x = "100";
            let y = "10";
            let z = x * y;  // 1000 ✅ works

            let x = "100";
            let y = "10";
            let z = x / y;  /10 ✅ works


#) NaN - Not a Number:
    - NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number.
    - Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number):

        eg:
            let i = 50;
            let j = "Apple";
            let k = i / j;  // NaN

            let l = 50;
            let m = "10";
            let n = l / m;  // NaN
    
    - You can use the global JavaScript function isNaN() to find out if a value is a not a number:
        eg:
            let p = 50 / "Apple";
            isNan(p);
    
    - ⚠️ NaN is a number: 
        eg:
            typeof NaN; // number


#) Infinity:
    - Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside
        the largest possible number.
        eg:
            let myNumber = 2;
            let text = "";
            // execute until infinity
            while(myNumber != Infinity){
                myNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
                text = text + myNumber + "<br>";
            }
            document.getElementById("infinity").innerHTML = text;
        
            o/p =   4
                    16
                    256
                    65536
                    4294967296
                    18446744073709552000
                    3.402823669209385e+38
                    1.157920892373162e+77
                    1.3407807929942597e+154
                    Infinity
    
    - Division by 0 (zero) also generates Infinity:
        eg:
            let x =  2 / 0;
            let y = -2 / 0;
    
    - ⚠️ Infinity is a number: 
        eg:
            typeof Infinity ; // number.


#) Hexadecimal:
    - JavaScript interprets numeric constants as hexadecimal if they are preceded by 0x.
        eg:
            let x = 0xFF;   // 255
    
    - ⚠️ Never write a number with a leading zero (like 07). Some JavaScript versions interpret numbers
        as octal if they are written with a leading zero.
    - By default, JavaScript displays numbers as base 10 decimals.
    - But you can use the toString() method to output numbers from base 2 to base 36.
    - Hexadecimal is base 16. Decimal is base 10. Octal is base 8. Binary is base 2.
        
            let myNumber = 32;

            myNumber.toString(36);  //  w
            myNumber.toString(32);  // 10
            myNumber.toString(16);  // 20
            myNumber.toString(12);  // 28
            myNumber.toString(10);  // 32
            myNumber.toString(8);   // 40
            myNumber.toString(2);   // 100000


#) JavaScript Numbers as Objects:
    - Numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:
        eg: let y = new Number(123);

        ⚠️ Do not create Number objects. The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
            Number Objects can produce unexpected results:
    
    -   let x = 500;
        let y = new Number(500);

        ⚠️ x == y   // true
        ⚠️ x === y  // false
    
    - 💡 Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.
