5. JavaScript Function Return:

- A function can return a value back to the code that called it.
- The return statement is used to send a value out of a function.
- A function can return any type of value (not only numbers).


#) The return Statement:
    - When a function reaches a return statement, the function stops executing.
    - The value after the return keyword is sent back to the caller.
    - Most functions return the result of a calculation or an operation.

#) Using Return Values in Expressions:
    - The returned value can be used anywhere a value is expected.
    - You can use a function call inside another expression.

        function multiply(a, b) {
            return a * b;
        }

        let total = multiply(2, 3) * 10;


#) Return Statements Stop Execution:
    - Code written after a return statement will NOT be executed.

        function multiply(a, b) {
            return "Done";
            // Next line will never run
            return a * b;
        }

        let result = multiply(4, 3);    // Done


#) Functions Without return:
    - ⚠️ IF A FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN A VALUE, THE RETURN VALUE WILL BE UNDEFINED.

        function multiply(a, b) {
            let x = a * b;
        }

        let result = multiply(4, 3);    // result = undefined


#) Returning Values Early:
    - You can use return to stop a function early, based on a condition.

        function vote(age) {
            if(age < 18) {  // stopping the function early if condition meet
                return "Too Young to vote";
            }
            return "Old enough to vote";
        }

        let message3 = vote(16);


⚠️) Common Mistakes
    - Forgetting Return
        A function without return sends back undefined.
    - Confusing console.log() with Return
        console.log() shows output but does not return a value.
    - Expecting Return
        If your function does not return a value, storing it in a variable will give undefined.

Code 1: ⚠️

    function vote(age) {
        if(age < 18) {
            return "Too Young to vote";
        }
        return "Old enough to vote";
    }
    let message = vote(16);
    console.log(message);

    Output(in console): 
        Too young to vote
    
    Reason:
    1) There is return statement, which means if the condition is meet early, execution gets 
        terminated early but the exection eventually gets terminated regardless of condition.
    2) Depending on where execution terminates, we get the respective return statement.


Code 2: ⚠️⚠️

    function vote(age) {
        if(age < 18) {
            console.log("Too Young to vote");
        }
        console.log("Old enough to vote");
    }
    let message = vote(16);
    console.log(message);

    Output(in console): 
        Too Young to vote
        Old enough to vote
        undefined
    
    Reason:
    1) There is no return statement to terminate the execution so wvery log gets outputed
    2) And since there is not return statement in the function, we also get undefined.


Code 3: ⚠️⚠️⚠️
    
    function vote(age) {
        if(age < 18) {
            console.log("Too Young to vote");
        }
        console.log("Old enough to vote");
    }
    let message = vote(21);
    console.log(message);

    Output(in console): 
        Old enough to vote
        undefined
    
    Reason:
    1) the first condition is never met so the respective log will not get outputed.


Code 4: ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
    
    function vote(age) {
        if(age < 18) {
            console.log("Too Young to vote");
        }
        console.log("Old enough to vote");
    }
    vote(16);
  

    Output(in console): 
        Too Young to vote
        Old enough to vote
    
    Reason:
    1) Even though the first condition is met execution never stopped because of not having return.
        so both logs gets outputed.
    2) if (age < 18) condition were not meet, only second log would'ce been outputed.


Code 5: ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
    
    function vote(age) {
        if(age < 18) {
            console.log("Too Young to vote");
        }
        console.log("Old enough to vote");
    }
    console.log(vote(16));
  

    Output(in console): 
        Too Young to vote
        Old enough to vote
        undefined
    
    Reason:
    1) Even though the first condition is met execution never stopped because of not having return.
        so both logs gets outputed.
    2) And undefined because of missing return statement
