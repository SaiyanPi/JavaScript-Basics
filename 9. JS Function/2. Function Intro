2. Function Intro

- Functions are reusable code blocks designed to perform a particular task.
- Functions are executed when they are called or invoked.
- Functions are fundamental in all programming.

#) Why Use Functions?
    - Functions help you to:
        -> Reuse code (write once, run many times)
        -> Organize code into smaller parts
        -> Make code easier to read and maintain


#) What Does a Function Look Like?
    - A function can be created with the function keyword, a name, and parentheses.
        The code to run is written inside curly brackets.

        function sayHello() {
            return "Hello World";
        }


#) Functions Run When You Call Them
    - To run a function, you call it by using its name followed by parentheses like sayHello():

        function sayHello() {
            return "Hello World";
        }

        let message = sayHello();   // Hello World

        -> () means execute now.


#) JavaScript Function Syntax:
    - syntax: 
            function name( p1, p2, ... ) {
                // code to be executed
            }
        
        -> The function name follows the naming rules for variables.
        -> Optional parameters are listed inside parentheses: ( p1, p2, ... )
        -> Code to be executed is listed inside curly brackets: { }
        -> Functions can return an optional value back to the caller.

            function multiply(a, b) {
                return a * b;
            }
        
        ⚠️ A function definition is not an executable statement.
        ⚠️ It is not common to end a function definition with a semicolon.
        ⚠️ Semicolons are used to separate executable JavaScript statements.


#) A Function Can Be Used Many Times:
    - A big benefit is that you can call the same function whenever you need it.

            function add(a, b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            let sum1 = add(5, 5);   
            let sum2 = add(50, 50);

        ⚠️ Note that values returned from functions can be stored in variables.


#) Local Variables:
    - Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
    - Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

            // code here can NOT use carName

            function myFunction() {
                let carName = "Volvo";
                // code here CAN use carName
            }

            // code here can NOT use carName
    
    - Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same
        name can be used in different functions.


#) Functions Used as Variables:
    - Functions can be used as variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.
        eg: 
            Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:

                let x = toCelsius(77);
                let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";

            You can use the function directly, as a variable value:

                let text = "The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";


#) Function Input and Output:
    - The most useful functions work like this:
        -> Parameter Input - some parameters go into the function   
        -> Function Code - some work is done inside the function
        -> Return Output - some value is returned from the function

    In the next three chapters, you will learn more about input and return values.
