7. Function Expression:

- A function expression is a function stored in a variable

    // Standard Function
    function multiply(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    // Function Expression
    const multiply = function(a, b) {
        return a * b;
    };

    const multiply = function (a, b) {return a * b};


- 💡 AFTER A FUNCTION EXPRESSION HAS BEEN STORED IN A VARIABLE, THE VARIABLE CAN BE USED AS A
    FUNCTION:

        const multiply = function (a, b) {return a * b};    // function expression

        let z = multiply(4, 3);                             // variable used as a function

- ⚠️ Function expression does not need a variable by default.
        
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log("Hello");
        }, 1000);


#) Anonymous Functions:
    - Function expressions are commonly used to create anonymous functions.
    - 💡 The function above is actually function without a name.
    - 💡 Functions stored in variables do not need names because
    - 💡 The variable name is used to call the function.
    - ⚠️ But function expression can also be named. So the function above can also be written as:
        
        const multiply = function multiply(a, b) { return a * b; };


#) Function Expressions Use Semicolons:
    - A function expression is a JavaScript statement. That is why it usually end with a semicolon.

#) Functions Stored in Variables:
    - Because a function expression is stored in a variable, it can be used like a value.
        This is useful when PASSING FUNCTIONS TO OTHER FUNCTIONS (callbacks).
    - A function expression can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to another function,
        or returned from a function.

            // function expression 
            function sayHello = function() {
                return "Hello";
            };

            // another function
            function run(fn) {
                return fn();
            }

            // passing function expression as an argument to another function.
            run(sayHello);  // Hello


#) Functions vs. Function Expressions:
    - In JavaScript, function declarations(simply a function) and function expression refer to
        different ways of defining functions, their different syntax and how they are handled:
    - They both work the same when you call them.
    - The difference is when they become available in your code(hoisting).


    ⚠️⚠️ Hoisting:
    - Function declarations(simply a function) can be called before they are defined.
    - Function expressions can not be called before they are defined.

    - Function declarations are "hoisted" to the top of their scope. This means you can call a
        function before it is defined in the code:

            let sum = add(2, 3); // ✅ Will work
            
            function add(a, b) {return a + b;}

    - Function expressions are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations. They are
        created when the execution reaches their definition, and cannot be called before that point:

            let sum = add(2, 3); // ❌ Will generate error

            const add = function (a, b) {return a + b;};
    
    ⚠️ Key Differences:
    - Syntax:
        Function declarations require a name. Function expressions can be anonymous.
    - Hoisting:
        Function declarations are hoisted. Function expressions are not.
    - Flexibility:
        Function declarations offer more flexibility in how and where they are used.
    
    ⚠️ When to Use Each:
    - Use function declarations for general-purpose functions
    - Use function expressions when assigning functions to variables
    - Use function expressions in callbacks and event handlers


#) Common Mistakes: 
    - Forgetting the Semicolon
        Function expressions are statement and should end with ; (semicolon).
        
    - Expecting Hoisting
        Function expression are not hoisted.
        You cannot call a function expression before it is defined.
        
    - Confusing Reference and Call
        sayHello is the function. sayHello() calls the function.

    - Confusing Function Names and Variables
        In expressions, the variable name is the function reference.
