JS Strings:

- Strings are for storing text
- Strings are written with single or double quotes
    eg:
        let answer1 = "It's alright";
        let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
        let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';


#) Template Strings:
    - Templates were introduced with ES6 (JavaScript 2016).
    - Templates are strings enclosed in backticks (`This is a template string`).
    - Templates allow single and double quotes inside a string:
        eg:
            let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;


#) String Length:
    - To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
        eg:
            let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
            let length = text.length;


#) Escape Characters:
    - Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:
        eg:
            let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
        
        -> The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called "
        -> To solve this problem, you can use an backslash escape character.
        -> The backslash escape character (\) turns special characters into string characters:

            let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
        
        Code	        Result	        Description
    ----------------------------------------------------
        \'	            '	            Single quote
        \"	            "	            Double quote
        \\	            \	            Backslash
    

    - Six other escape sequences are valid in JavaScript:
        Code	        Result
    ----------------------------------------------------
        \b	            Backspace
        \f	            Form Feed
        \n	            New Line
        \r	            arriage Return
        \t	            Horizontal Tabulator
        \v	            Vertical Tabulator
    
    ⚠️ The 6 escape characters above were originally designed to control typewriters, teletypes,
        and fax machines. They do not make any sense in HTML.


#) JavaScript Strings as Objects:
    - Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
        let x = "John";
    
    - But strings can also be defined as object with the keyword new:
        let y = new String("John");

        ⚠️ Do not create String objects.The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
        String objects can produce unexpected results:
